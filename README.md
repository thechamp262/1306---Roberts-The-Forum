Update: June 12th 

The api is running on the homepage and the user is able to sign-up for the website. 

Will add the sign-in page later today (June 12th)

(I will be adding the css to everything after I complete most of the functionality.)

Update: June 13th

The user login page is now up and running.

I've also added user athentication and the content on the homepage is now randomly generated.

I've made some changes to the style of the page as well(which is why I'm not adding the css until closer to the end of the project completion). I'll add the mock-up changes to the assets folder.
