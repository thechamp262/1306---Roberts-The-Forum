Update: June 12th 

The api is running on the homepage and the user is able to sign-up for the website. 

Will add the sign-in page later today (June 12th)

(I will be adding the css to everything after I complete most of the functionality.)

Update: June 13th

The user login page is now up and running.

I've also added user athentication and the content on the homepage is now randomly generated.

I've made some changes to the style of the page as well(which is why I'm not adding the css until closer to the end of the project completion). I'll add the mock-up changes to the assets folder. 

Update: June 20th

When signing up it checks the database to see if the entered username already exist. 

I've stated to add css to some of the pages.

When a user logs in and goes to the homepage, the info on the homepage is about their fav artist.

The user now has the ability to edit their profile and add a bio.

Added a link to the api site echonest.com

I will be adding different fonts for the logo and headers.

I might take the reviews off of the logged in homepage and add them to a page called reviews I obtain from a different api, but I'm not sure yet.

I will be adding a link that will take the user to a profile page of their fav artist. 

4 random photos will now be shown on the join page. I'm thinking about adding album artwork to the side to the sign-up form on that page. 

Will added the ablity to delete profile
